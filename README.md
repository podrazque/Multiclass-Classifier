# Multiclass-Classifier
A project I did for one of my classes in 5-6 hours who's goal was to correctly classify given data.

We were given a dataset from a "Fitbit" device and X,Y,Z coordinates of certain tasks. We were required to create models and correctly classify these tasks by using a Random Forest Classifier and KMeans clustering. 

I also tested other classifiers like KNeighbors but I didn't have time to wrap it up nicely and present the data since the deadline was that day.
